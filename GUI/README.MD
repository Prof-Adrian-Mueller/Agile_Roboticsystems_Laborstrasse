This is a Dashboard Application for Agile Roboticsystems Laborstrasse, which is created using PyQt6.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following components are installed :
- Python 3.9 or later
- pip (Python Package Installer)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using Git.

git clone https://github.com/Prof-Adrian-Mueller/Agile_Roboticsystems_Laborstrasse.git
```

2. **Navigate** into the main folder `Agile_Roboticsystems_Laborstrasse`.

```bash
cd Agile_Roboticsystems_Laborstrasse
```

3. **Create a virtual environment** in the main folder. We'll name it `venv`.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**. On Windows, use:

venv\Scripts\activate
```

On Unix or MacOS, use:
